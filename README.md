# What the Project Does
The project is focused on recognizing handwritten digits using a machine learning model built with TensorFlow. It leverages a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained on thousands of labeled examples and can accurately predict the digit represented in new, unseen images. This project showcases the application of deep learning techniques to image recognition tasks, providing a practical example of how neural networks can be used for digit classification.

### How Users Can Get Started with the Project

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

Additionally, you will need the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for running the `.ipynb` file)

#### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandwrittenDigitsRecognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd HandwrittenDigitsRecognition
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

#### Basic Usage
1. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```sh
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the `Handwritten_digits_recognition_using_Tensorflow.ipynb` file in your browser.

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook to load the MNIST dataset, build the neural network model, train the model on the dataset, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Making Predictions**:
   - After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on new images of handwritten digits by running the appropriate cells in the notebook.
